PDF-shape is a Rust library dedicated to analyse XML files produced by pdf2xml

## Features

Implemented :

- Alignement extraction
- Coordinates extraction
- Shape extraction
- Spacing extraction
- Style extraction
- Style extraction
- Blocks extraction (get all the block elements of a given document)
- Texts extraction (get all the text elements of a given document)
- Tokens extraction (get all the token elements of a given document)

Not implemented yet:

- Line detection

- Paragraph detection
- Blocks detection

## Examples

You can run the example with :

```
cargo run --example=main
```

## Documentation

You can build the documentation with :

```
cargo doc --open --lib --no-deps
```

## Concepts

### Shape (width/heigt) and spacing (vertical/horizontal)

The following diagram represents the shape of objects/set of objects and the spacing between them

![Diagram Shape and Objects](./images/shape.svg)

### Line detection

A line is a set of objects sharing the same base or a set of objects which are horizontally aligned. Horizontal spacing between objects shouldn't be greater than the horizontal spacing mode of the document.

### Columns detection

### Paragraph detection

A paragraph is a set of lines that are equally spaced vertically. In most cases the paragraph spacing should be greater than the document line spacing. Each paragraph lines have to be vertically aligned.

#### Orphans detection
